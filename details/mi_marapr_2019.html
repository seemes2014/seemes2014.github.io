<h5>Hijabistan</h5>

<p><b>Problems of burkha-clad Muslim women</b><p>
<p>
Hijabistan is a land of women - where a lot of stereotypes get bombarded and shredded to pieces. The protagonists of this collection of stories are not the usual timid ones that are repressed or whose voices have been stifled. They have a mind of their own - and they make it known to those around them. Any attempts to bring them 'back to line' are thwarted with the strong characters that Javeri fills the book with. The women come from various strata but the commonality that binds them is that - they are all Muslim women.
