<h5>MRG Trishna and Other Poems</h5>

<p>
Indu Mallah's poems give the reader a glimpse of that journey which has to be made before one can pour out how one feels about the way things work. There is a beautiful poem titled 'Jugalbandhi' (duet in its simplest definition) and it brings up the relationship between a mother and a daughter with the help of various ragas of Hindustani classical music; the father remains in the background but it's the play on words in this poem as well as in the book that needs to be paid attention to.
