<h5>Celebrating Poetry</h5>

<p>
The title - Coconuts on Mars as well as the cover photo of the book draws one's curiosity to the contents of the book. It is not an easy read, as least not when you read it the first time but the book unravels beautifully only if you stay on a page for some time and breathe in the air that it wants you to feel and be a part of, even if momentarily. The idea of writing poetry is not only to capture everyday life or philosophize but to get down to the roots of it all; its etymology. Amirthanayagam's book does not deconstruct words for us but explains why it becomes necessary to use words to identify oneself.
