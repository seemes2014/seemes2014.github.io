<h5>Five Novellas about Women by Indira Goswami. Translated by Dibyajyoti Sarma</h5>

<p>The book leaves the readers with a multitude of questions to respond to; to exhume the monsters that one is riddled with as one tries to survive in a world that seeks its own redemption by demanding of an individual to sacrifice their needs and desires. The book removes the curtain that one feels comfortable sitting behind; and one increasingly feels the chasm that is between a reader and the multifarious voices that emerge from across the country.
