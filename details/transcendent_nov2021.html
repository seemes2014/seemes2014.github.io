<h5>Noise Cancellation by Jhilam Chattaraj</h5>

<p>The poetry collection derives its inspiration from not just Eliot, but has traces of Ezra Pound's imagist style of writing to echoes of Nissim Ezkiel's poem Night of the Scorpion. One of the poems that stand out is an interesting take on John Donne's The Flea - giving it a desi flavour and in quite an impressive manner. Echoes of Michael Cunningham's The Hours reverberate in a few poems making the collection a space where one can discuss not only how a place has been represented but also makes it a discussion on the re-presentation of selves and the constant engagement with divergent histories and one's place in them.
