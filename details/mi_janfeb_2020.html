<h5>
One Foot on the Ground: A Life Told Through the Body
</h5>

<p>
When you pick up an autobiography - the first assumption that one makes is how it would be reduced to a mere tracing back of one's roots and where one came from. In reading autobiographies written by women; what one inevitably - let's just say stereotypically assumes are how emotions would overrule the narrative. But we tend to forget that when a woman writes, it is not just about how life has been rather there is an active involvement with deciphering her own experiences. Since the genre requires talking in the first person, it helps the writer explore her life in the sequence in which she desires. Thereby opening up a space to highlight what she considers as important sections in her life that supports her motive to write.
