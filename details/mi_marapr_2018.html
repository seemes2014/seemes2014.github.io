<p>It is difficult to read through a book like this one and not use lines to portray the various wavelengths at which the poet processes the world around him. Words have an ability to transform the self - the pen writes it and the paper that reads it. The book has been reviewed by using multiple extracts from the work as it is one of those few books that, as a reader and a reviewer I have come across, that needs to be illustrated by its work rather than be explained through only a reviewer's point of view.

<p>Emptied of heart.</p>
