<h5>The Madness of the Word</h5>

<p>This edition brings forth a collection of voices that look into the definitions of what really is madness. The ease with which the poets in this collection have explored the theme has to be read and savoured. Savoured not for what they have to offer; but for what they saw in us and therefore in themselves. For we are all mirrors facing each other endlessly. We always leave a part of ourselves in what we write down.  Words are but constructs - constructs that we consider as ours but are no one's to claim and command. The writers in this collection of voices use words to give you a glimpse into what they see; what they have tried to give vent to. Fiction is not just fiction but a story of one's life that has percolated down into small fractions of light for others to experience but not understand in its totality. The essays and an interview placed between these forms of writings critically examine various types of narratological methods that have been used by contemporary writers in their respective works.</p>
