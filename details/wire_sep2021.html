<h5>A Moveable East by Siddharth Dasgupta</h5>

<p>Poet Siddharth Dasgupta has the heart of a nomad, a fact which comes across beautifully in his recent collection titled A Movable East. Dasgupta calls his book "an archiving of the east". The cities that have been archived in this collection are the ones he drifts in and out of, and he weaves them together to turn them into a seamless narrative of his journey home.
