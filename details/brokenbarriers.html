<p>The first book of poetry Broken Barriers was published by P.Lal- Writers Workshop, Calcutta in 2008.</p>

<p>This book is a compilation of observations on people - known and unknown who have made the poet question the dynamics of relationships and to what extent can one break the "barriers" that we keep creating around ourselves. What the poet tries to capture through her work is when a certain perception is broken, at that very moment a fresh perception is created and one adheres to that perception till a new one doesn't come along to break it and the cycle continues.

<p>The book is available with the <a href="http://www.writersworkshopindia.com/" target="_new">publisher</a>.
