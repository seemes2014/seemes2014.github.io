<h5>Redundant by Bitan Chakraborty </h5>

<p>In exploring the theme of migration, metropolitan cities have been central to several literary narratives. The migrant worker in search of better work opportunities leaves his home behind and comes to the city in search of a better life. An individual unhappy with the life conditions/factors that one is born into, comes to the city that gives him/ her a sense of anonymity, allowing an individual to think and act beyond the constricting rules that are a part of the homes they come from.
