<h5>Poetry Fervour</h5>

<p>

	The survival of any form of expression, be it in writing or through orality, depends a lot on its adaptive abilities. Here I will focus on poetry and its varied paths, adapting itself and surviving. If the avant-garde form of writing was at its peak and continues to trickle down and impact the current form of expressing oneself, then one cannot ignore the impact the Romantics had over an entire generation of people at different points in time. I have provided a very basic example of the vast form of experimentation that poetry has undertaken to remain relevant. I unfortunately use the word relevant here as increasingly one observes the changes that we as readers are experiencing and are a part of.
