<p>The two poems were published in Hudson View Poetry, Spring 2011 (volume 6, number 2) and in both the poems the theme of recreating the self is explored. The hitch hiker that exists in all of us can either take us into new experiences or stifle us by remaining rooted at a particular junction.  The concept of hitch hiking is taken beyond the usual definition and the second poem while taking its inspiration from the river Ganga turns a hitch hiker to contemplate on what lies at the end of the road.
