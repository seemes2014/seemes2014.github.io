<h5>A Potpourri Of Poetry Collections</h5>

<p>
The temporalities of one's life are divided into past, present and the future. In living towards one's future, there is always the far end that remains at the back of one's mind-death. Now in everyday living, the conscious mind refutes this theory and tries to suppress this idea but it is in literature, in poetry that this idea forms the crux of the genre. The melancholia that surrounds us and cannot be brushed away is celebrated and it finds a place in this book by Hemant Divate.
