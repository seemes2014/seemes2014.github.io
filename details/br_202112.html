<h5>The Bombay Prince by Sujata Massey </h5>

<p>The Bombay Prince is set in 1921 with Edward VIII, Prince of Wales and the future ruler of India coming to India; which sets off riots in Bombay as many protest against his visit. An eighteen year old Parsi female student, Freny Cuttingmaster falls to her death from the second floor of her college. Her death occurs around the time the Prince is passing by the college. The events that it sets off and the people that get embroiled in solving/getting investigated related to the cause of death sets off questions that are no longer limited to solving a murder mystery.
