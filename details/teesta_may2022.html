<h5>Vanishing words by Sukrita Paul Kumar</h5>

<p>
    Sukrita Paul Kumar's new book of poems titled Vanishing Words turns to poetry to establish a relationship of words, one's individuality and one's identity with nature and its elements. The book documents not just a journey of an individual on a philosophical level but the environmental inclinations that jump out of its pages which one cannot overlook. There is a celebration of one's own retreat from an ever-demanding and an ever-challenging world that one has created and become a part of.
