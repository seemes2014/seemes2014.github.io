<h5>Mahanadi: The Tale of a River by Anita Agnihotri. Translated by Dr. Nivedita Sen</h5>

<p>With a keen eye, Dr. Sen has beautifully translated the book which transitions into another language smoothly. The text turns into a performative one - it traces and tracks the route of the actual river and also uses the river as a metaphor to traverse the several lives and events that feature in this novel, thus blurring the boundaries between reality and literature. The journey of the river begins from the plateau of Chhattisgarh and ends at Jagatsinghpur on the Bay of Bengal. It crosses villages and settlements that are full of their own tales; sharing the power that the river wields over memory and how it is tied up with identity.
