<h5>The Awasthis of Aamnagri</h5>

<p>
On families Arundhati Roy in her book The God of Small Things observes - "This was the trouble with families. Like invidious doctors, they knew just where it hurt." The Awasthis of Aamnagri written by Shubha Sarma takes on this observation as the novel unfolds. Spanning over a few years divided into episodes, the book gives a glimpse of a family that initially sets out to live together.
