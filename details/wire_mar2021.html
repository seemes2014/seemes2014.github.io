<h5>Echoing a Shadow by Soniya Kanchan</h5>

<p>In Soniya Kanchan's Echoing a Shadow, the opening poem sets the tone for the book and the accompanying photograph gives a glimpse of what to expect from this slim volume of poetry.
I will begin by talking a bit about the photographs that have been used in this book. Photographs, as Susan Sontag observes in her book On Photography are "an anthology of images". Now an anthology can be as diverse and as similar when it comes to the works that are a part of it. Be it the visual medium or the written one used to express oneself; the idea is to bring together different voices.
