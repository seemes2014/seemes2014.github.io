A pandemic hit world has been quite a different and difficult one, and for those who have stepped out of that storm, nothing can describe it better than this quote from Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore:

And once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.

Nothing escapes poetry and it is interesting to note and read how poets are grappling with a world that is still in the clutches of a pandemic, but that pandemic now looms in the background. There are echoes of it that one cannot escape from, nor can one close one's eyes and ears to it. It surrounds us and it is here to stay. The poets know it all too well as they gather to sing songs of victory and strength and sorrow and loss.
