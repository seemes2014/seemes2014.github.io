<p>The three poems were published in The Dance of the Peacock - An Anthology of English Poetry from India in 2013 published by Hidden Brook Press. The three poems have been taken from Ali's books- Broken Barriers and Rose & Ashes.  The claustrophobic environment that is created for us and the one we create for ourselves has been explored through these poems. One is trapped in it and grows to make oneself comfortable remaining in that situation. While the questioning continues, there are no attempts made to break out of it.
