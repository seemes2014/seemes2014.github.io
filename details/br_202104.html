<h5>Exquisite Cadavers, Meena Kandasamy </h5>

<p>
With Exquisite Cadavers, Meena Kandasamy creates two sets of narratives that run parallel with each other. The voices are distinct. In the borders of the book runs the voice of the writer, introducing snippets of her life as well as herself while the main page is left for her characters to negotiate their identities in the spaces that they have created or have been given to them.
