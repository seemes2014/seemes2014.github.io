<h5>ATTRAVERSIAMO: CROSSING OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF SURVIVAL by Saniya Puri</h5>

<p>
	The cover of this slim volume of poems is of a flower blossoming and the uneven lines drawn on every petal sets the tone for the ideas that are enclosed within its spaces. On first glance, one is not prepared for what follows inside the book. The stereotypical set of ideas pertaining to flowers and colour schemes that one has been conditioned to, and the way one casually looks at the surface, does not prepare us for the powerful assemblage of poems that will shake you to your core.
