<h5>A Red-Necked Green Bird by 'Ambai' CS Lakshmi. Translated by GJV Prasad</h5>

<p>The stories do not work at a surface level creating ripples but plunge deep inside to look at what lies beyond. The idea of falling not only has been explored at a literal level but also takes on a metaphorical meaning with protagonists questioning themselves at every turn of their lives. A reference to their past not only brings up a compendium of memories that haven't been put to rest but also keeps the fresh ones from getting added to them thereby forming a sedimentation inside one’s heart.
