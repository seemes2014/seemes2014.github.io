<p>The two poems were published in Suvarnarekha - An Anthology of Indian Women Poets Writing in English in 2014, published by The Poetry Society of India.  The two poems have been taken from Ali's books - Origins and Rose & Ashes. The first one explores the various versions of a story that are created and how one holds one to a version that one is comfortable living with. The second poem brings out the transitory state of mind which one possesses.
