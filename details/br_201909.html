<h5>Interim Seasons Of The Self</h5>

<p>
The echoes of the above sentence reverberate throughout the book. For what is chaos? That which resides inside one's head and reaches the heart slowly but is supposed to remain hidden: not shown or shared. The short stories in this book are not supposed to jolt you out of your quiet existence nor will they attempt to. But by giving a glimpse into lives it sends across a powerful message of the various forms of 'waiting' that one has to live with. The writer does not mince her words as she opens up lives for the readers to see for themselves the heavy bearing the word can bring with it - the wait to be acknowledged/respected for who one is and the struggle to come to terms with one's own identity.</p>
