<h5>In Search of the Pitcher of Nectar by Samaresh Bose</h5>

<p>
    Samaresh Bose's (Kalkut) travelogue Amrita Kumbher Sadhnaney (In Search of the Pitcher of Nectar) translated into English language was originally published in 1954. The writer travels to Allahabad (now known as Prayagraj) to be a part of the Kumbh Mela that is held every 12 years in the month of Magh.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, the publication year of the book coincides with the first Kumbh Mela held in Allahabad post-Independence. The travelogue immerses itself in a sea of people where some gather to find answers for the vagaries that life has surrounded them with; to people who have turned up at this place to release themselves from the never-ending circle of questions and answers.
