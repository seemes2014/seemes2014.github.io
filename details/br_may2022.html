<h5>SPEAK, WOMAN! by Smita Agarwal</h5>

<p>On reading the poems in Speak Woman! what comes up powerfully is how the world is perceived and made visible through the eyes of Agarwal. She is visible in her poems and makes sure that her presence and that of other women are not reduced to being in the background in comparison to traditional forms of writing where one is supposed to remove oneself from actively identifying with their works. It remains essential as a poet to respond to the world that they live in, in ways that is unique to them as an individual. In these poems, the usage of personal experiences helps create a compelling narrative about life/lives of a/the woman/women.
