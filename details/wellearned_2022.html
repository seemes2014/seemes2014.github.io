<p>Her poem features in this anthology. Celebrating the 75th Independence Day, Hawakal presents an evocatively offbeat anthology, distinctly observing how poets perceive the very idea of freedom and consequently voice them. In times when hate-mongering is the ethos of the day, love should spread like a contagion. In the telling, this collection translates into snapshots of stories, where memories have been dislocated yet find tranquility in bits and pieces.</p>
