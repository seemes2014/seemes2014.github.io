<h5>The Coordinates of Us by Sanket Mhatre & Rochelle Potkar</h5>

<p>Language is no longer segregated into private and public spaces in this book, rather, it turns into a nexus between memories including cultural memories, and how one's identity is tied up with it. It becomes an essential domain for an individual to express a world that hides between the folds of words and a persona that one needs to project. What this particular collection of poetry does is bring in two poets who are writing/translating in two languages - Marathi and English.
