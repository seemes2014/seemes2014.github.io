<h5>Aangan ka Shajar by Mamta Kiran</h5>

<p>Aangan ka Shajar or the The Tree in the Courtyard is a collection of ghazals written by Mamta Kiran. The title is an interesting one as it sets the tone for the book. The tree of verses branch out to include several thematic concerns that fill the pages of this book. And the courtyard turns into a witness to read the stories of the leaves that fall on it. What Mamta does with her verses is that she combines the elements from contemporary times - and its proponents into this format. From including words like Twitter and Whatsapp, to including idioms common to the Hindi language, Mamta defies the set parameters that one expects when reading or writing a ghazal.
