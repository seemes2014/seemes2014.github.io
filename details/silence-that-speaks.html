<h5>The Silence That Speaks: Short Stories by Indian Muslim Women</h5>

<p>
    Semeen Ali's “Origins” is a story about the relationship that a granddaughter shares with her grandmother. It is a compendium of snapshot memories, that the one from the younger generation is left with. The account brings up moments from the life of her grandmother, as seen and observed, by the granddaughter, that question a lot of stereotypes that seem to circulate around women coming from a specific background and culture.
