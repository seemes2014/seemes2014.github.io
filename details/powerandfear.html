<p>A historical perspective on dissent in India and the conflicts that have arisen between writers and the government at various times would be instrumental in understanding to what level are we free to express our views and to what level are we expected to follow the required patterns of thought and speech without disturbing the so- called social fabric. A structure of power takes the form of relationships and can be gendered - misogyny, homophobia to name a few. There are a range of power relations that have been explored in Indian literature. One needs to keep in mind how complex these forms of power can be and how complex these can become in literature.<p>

<p>For this issue, to be edited by Semeen Ali, Muse India invites submissions in the form of fiction, non-fiction, interviews, book reviews and poems that explore the uneasy relationship between the voices of dissent and the dominant modes of expression to be found in the Indian context since colonial times.</p>
