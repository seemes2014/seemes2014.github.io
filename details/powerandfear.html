<i>Power in the substantive sense le pouvoir , doesn't exist... The idea that there is either located at - or emanating from - a given point something which is a 'power' seems to me to be based on a misguided analysis, one which at all events fails to account for a considerable number of phenomena. In reality power means relations, a more or less, organized, hierarchical, co-ordinated cluster of relations. (Foucault)</i>

<p>Dissent is an integral part of a citizen's rights - what one feel is just and fights for it or gives voice to his/her concerns if that freedom to dissent is trampled upon, is a right in itself. The suppression of dissent is not new and one can go far back in history to see circumstances or events that required questioning of the way things work.</p>

<p>Literature has always been a platform for the voices of dissent and it becomes important to explore Indian literature to look for examples where such voices have emerged or are emerging. The idea of intolerance that refuses to listen to another's point of view is something that literature has always needed to reckon with. The ban on the seminal text of Gandhiji - Hind Swaraj -  and other similar suppressions of literary and non-literary texts for a variety of reasons from pre-independence times to the current scenario, through successive governments, present the perennial struggles between the right of the citizen and the need the state feels to lay curbs on the freedom of expression.</p>

<p>A historical perspective on dissent in India and the conflicts that have arisen between writers and the government at various times would be instrumental in understanding to what level are we free to express our views and to what level are we expected to follow the required patterns of thought and speech without disturbing the so- called social fabric. A structure of power takes the form of relationships and can be gendered - misogyny, homophobia to name a few.  There are a range of power relations that have been explored in Indian literature. One needs to keep in mind how complex these forms of power can be and how complex these can become in literature.</p> 

<p>For this issue, to be edited by Semeen Ali, Muse India invites submissions in the form of fiction, non-fiction, interviews, book reviews and poems that explore the uneasy relationship between the voices of dissent and the dominant modes of expression to be found in the Indian context since colonial times.</p>
