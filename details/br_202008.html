<h5>Melody of a Tear</h5>

<p>
It is the act of standing still that reverberates throughout the novel in diverse ways and takes on new meanings in every turn of the page in the novel. The story is not just about a girl who is growing up in a very ambiguous relationship with her own self but is also about how people around her begin to question themselves as well as their relationship with the world.
