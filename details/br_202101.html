<h5>Shimmer Spring: Prose And Poetry</h5>

<p>'Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one's hand.' -  Ezra Pound</p>
<p>As I began reading this anthology of poetry and prose, these lines by Ezra Pound seemed to reverberate across the entire volume of writings. In a new phase of world that we are living in and trying to cope with, the book brings with it a glimmer of hope that one hopes to hold on to and live in.
